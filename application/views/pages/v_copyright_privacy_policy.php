      <p> <strong>COUNTER-NOTICE</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"> If you  receive a notification that your Contribution or User-generated  content provided through the My Story Services, including on the  Website has been removed due to a claim of copyright infringement in  a DMCA Copyright Notice, it means that the Contribution&rsquo;s content  has been deleted from the My Story Services at the request of the  content's owner.

Upon receipt of  a valid Counter-Notice, we will forward a copy to the person who  filed the original DMCA Copyright Notice. If we do not receive notice  within 10 business days that the submitter of the original claims in  their DMCA Copyright Notice is seeking a court order to prevent  further infringement of the content at issue, we will remove the  claim and the DMCA Copyright Notice from your account's record, and  we may, but are not obligated to, replace the Contribution that was  removed.</p>
      <p align="justify"> Note: There  are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith  submissions. Before submitting a Counter-Notice, be sure that you are  the actual rights holder of the removed content or that you have a  good faith belief that the material was removed in error, and  understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</p>
